#### 19. [Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
---
Given a linked list, remove the *n*-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
**Note:**

Given *n* will always be valid.

**Follow up:**

Could you do this in one pass?

#### Thoughts
---
My first idea was to go throught listNode at first in order to get the "length" of the listNode, and then locate the 'length - n' position, skip the next one. But this certainlly not "in one pass".  
So I check the hint: 
> Maintain two pointers and update one with a delay of n steps.

then I realized what it means after few more tries.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode res = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode b = res;
        ListNode bac = head;
        int i = 0;
        while (head != null) {
            head = head.next;
            i++;
            if (i > n) {
                b.next = bac;
                bac = bac.next;
                b = b.next;
            }
        }
        b.next = bac.next;

        return res.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **11 ms**, faster than **24.42%** of Java online submissions for Remove Nth Node From End of List.

> Runtime: **7 ms**, faster than **66.01%** of Java online submissions for Remove Nth Node From End of List.

> Runtime: **10 ms**, faster than **31.02%** of Java online submissions for Remove Nth Node From End of List.

hmm, I should go and find out why they can be this fast.

```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        if(head.next == null && n == 1)
            return null;
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy, slow = dummy;
        
        int k = 1;
        while(fast.next!=null){
            fast = fast.next;
            if(k > n){
                slow=slow.next;
            }
            k++;
        }
        // using dummy head, making below situation the same solution:
        // 1. slow==head,remove slow;
        // 2. slow==head,remove slow.next;
        slow.next = (slow.next == null ? null : slow.next.next);
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
**Result 2:**
