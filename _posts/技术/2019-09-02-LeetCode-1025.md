#### [1025. Divisor Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/)
---
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
 ```

**Note:**
1. 1 <= N <= 1000

Here's why [just return N % 2 == 0 (proof)](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisor-game/discuss/274566/just-return-N-2-0-(proof))

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean divisorGame(int N) {
        return N % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Divisor Game.   
Memory Usage: **32.8 MB**, less than **13.33%** of Java online submissions for Divisor Game.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
