#### [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)
---
Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which ***minimizes*** the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

Though I know I should use DP to solve this problem, I still didn't know how, not until I saw the first paragraph of this article [leetcode 64. Minimum Path Sum-最小路径和|动态规划](https://blog.csdn.net/happyaaaaaaaaaaa/article/details/51546526)

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int h = grid.length;
        if(h==0) return 0;
        int w = grid[0].length;
        if(h==1 && w==0) return 0;
        
        for(int j = 1; j<w; j++) grid[0][j]+=grid[0][j-1];// first line
        for(int i = 1; i<h; i++) grid[i][0]+=grid[i-1][0];// first column
        
        for(int i = 1; i<h; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j<w; j++){
                grid[i][j]+=Math.min(grid[i-1][j],grid[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return grid[h-1][w-1];
    }
    
    
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **2 ms**, faster than **90.12%** of Java online submissions for Minimum Path Sum.  
Memory Usage: **41.5 MB**, less than **89.19%** of Java online submissions for Minimum Path Sum.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
