#### 36. [Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)
---
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

A partially filled sudoku which is valid.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being 
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```
**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
- The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
- The given board size is **always** `9x9`.

#### Thoughts

The logic is quite simple, check every `3x3` and row and column in the board, return false once the role is unsatisfied.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        boolean res = true;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < 9 && res) {
            char[][] col = new char[1][9];
            for (int j = 0; res && j < 9; j++) {
                // column's value
                col[0][j] = board[j][i];
                // role 3
                res = check9(board, i % 3 * 3, j % 3 * 3, i % 3 * 3 + 3, j % 3 * 3 + 3);
            }
            if (res) {
                // role 2
                res = check9(col, 0, 0, 1, 9);
                if (res) {
                    col[0] = board[i];
                    // role 1
                    res = check9(col, 0, 0, 1, 9);
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }

        return res;
    }

    private static boolean check9(char[][] b, int r, int c, int rEnd, int cEnd) {
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();

        int not = 0;
        for (int i = r; i < rEnd; i++) {
            for (int j = c; j < cEnd; j++)
                if (b[i][j] == '.')
                    not++;
                else
                    set.add(b[i][j]);
        }
        // the number in b is always equal to 9
        return set.size() == 9 - not;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **27 ms**, faster than **71.55%** of Java online submissions for Valid Sudoku.

The speed was ok, and I try to optimized my code on the first part. The pre code checked role 3 lots of time, so I change that part of code to reduce the times checking role 3.

**Second try:**
```
for (int j = 0; res && j < 9; j++) {
    if (j / 3 == 0 && i / 3 == 0)
        res = check9(board, i % 3 * 3, j % 3 * 3, i % 3 * 3 + 3, j % 3 * 3 + 3);
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **27 ms**, faster than **71.55%** of Java online submissions for Valid Sudoku.

But the result was the same.
