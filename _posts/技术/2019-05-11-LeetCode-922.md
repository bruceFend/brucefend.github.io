#### [922. Sort Array By Parity II](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity-ii/)
---
Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, **half** of the integers in `A` are odd, and **half** of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever `A[i]` is odd, `i` is odd; and whenever `A[i]` is even, `i` is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
```
**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 20000`
1. `A.length % 2 == 0`
1. `0 <= A[i] <= 1000`

#### Thoughts

I tried to solve this using same idea as [#905](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/), do
```
while(i<j && (A[i] % 2 == i % 2)) i++;
while(i<j && (A[j] % 2 != j % 2)) j--;
```
however, it turned to be an error when the input looks like: 
`[4,2,5,7,1,4]`, when `A[1]` and `A[5]` all need to be change.

So I decided to move all the even number ahead, after this, exchange the number base on the `index`.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortArrayByParityII(int[] A) {
        // move all the even number ahead
        A = sortArrayByParity(A);
        int len = A.length;
        int i=1, j=len-2;
        
        while(i<j){
            if(i<j){
                A[i]+=A[j];
                A[j]=A[i]-A[j];
                A[i]=A[i]-A[j];
                i+=2;
                j-=2;
            }
        }
        return A;
    }
    
    public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] A) {
        int len = A.length;
        int i = 0, j = len - 1;
        
        while(i<j){
            // find first odd
            while(i<j && A[i] % 2 ==0) i++;
            // find first even
            while(i<j && A[j] % 2 !=0) j--;
            
            if(i<j){
                A[i]+=A[j];
                A[j]=A[i]-A[j];
                A[i]=A[i]-A[j];
            }
        }
        
        return A;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **3 ms**, faster than **74.85%** of Java online submissions for Sort Array By Parity II.  
Memory Usage: **40.9 MB**, less than **94.16%** of Java online submissions for Sort Array By Parity II.

There must be a better way.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
