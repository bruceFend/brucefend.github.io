#### [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given a **non-empty**, singly linked list with head node `head`, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
``` 

**Note:**

The number of nodes in the given list will be between `1` and `100`.

#### Thoughts

This can be done by using two pointer, one moves one step each time and the other moves two step, while the *sec reach the end, the *first also reach the middle of the list.


**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        if(head.next == null)
            return head;
        
        ListNode fi = head;
        ListNode se = head;
        while(se != null && se.next != null ){
            fi = fi.next;
            se = se.next.next;
        }
        return fi;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **1 ms**, faster than **81.99%** of Java online submissions for Middle of the Linked List.  
> Memory Usage: **36.7 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Middle of the Linked List.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
