#### [392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)
---
Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both **s** and **t**. **t** is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and **s** is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Example 1:**
```
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.
```
**Example 2:**
```
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.
```

**Follow up:**
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if(null == s || s.length()==0) return true;
        
        int i=0,j = 0;
        while(i<s.length() && j<t.length()){
            while(i<s.length() && s.charAt(i)==t.charAt(j)){
                t.charAt(j)); 
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            if(i>=s.length()) {
                 return true;
            } else
                j++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
```
Runtime Error Message:
Line 8: java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 6

Last executed input:
"acb"
"ahbgdc"
```

Update condition `j`.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if(null == s || s.length()==0) return true;
        
        int i=0,j = 0;
        while(i<s.length() && j<t.length()){
            while(i<s.length() && j<t.length() && s.charAt(i)==t.charAt(j)){
                t.charAt(j)); 
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            if(i>=s.length()) {
                 return true;
            } else
                j++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **16 ms**, faster than **55.88%** of Java online submissions for Is Subsequence.   
Memory Usage: **48.1 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Is Subsequence.
