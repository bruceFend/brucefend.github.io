#### [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II]()
---
Say you have an array for which the `i^th` element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete **as many transactions as you like** (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Similar with [#121](http://www.wushifengzi.xyz/2019/05/05/LeetCode-121.html), only that we can buy and sell several times.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length;
        if(len <= 1)
            return 0;
        
        int res = 0, max = 0;
        int buy = prices[0];
        
        for(int i=1; i<len; i++){
            if(prices[i] < buy){
                buy = prices[i];
            }else{
                max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - buy);
                res += max;
                // reset
                buy = prices[i];
                max = 0;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
