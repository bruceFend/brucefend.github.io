#### 206. [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
---
Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```
**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

#### Thoughts

This question should be an easy one, however, I spend so much time on it. Shame on myself.  
I tried to solved this with three pointer, one always pointed to the *head* of the listNode, one pointed to the *newHead* and the last pointed to the *next newHead*. 
```Java
// 1-2-3-4-5
// *head, *p2 = newHead = 2, *p3 = next newHead = 3;

while(*p2 != null){
    // 1-3-4-5
    *head.next = *p3;
    // 2-1-3-4-5
    *p2.next = *head;
    // 2-1-3-4-5
    // *p2 = 3, *p3 = 4;
    /** I wish *head now pointed to the newHead, which is 2, 
    but it's not actually */
    *p2 = *p3;
    *p3 = *p3.next;
}
```
But this can't be done not until I add one more ListNode helping *head moving to the newHead. It took me so long to realizing my stupid mistake.  
Then I solve this in another way :
```
// 1-2-3-4-5
*p1 = 1, *p2 = 2, *p3 = 3;
1. 1← 2 3-4-5 // *p1 = 2, *p2 = 3, *p3 = 4
2. 1← 2←3 4-5 // *p1 = 3, *p2 = 4, *p3 = 5
3. 1← 2←3←4 5 // *p1 = 4, *p2 = 5, *p3 = null break
4. 1← 2←3←4←5 // *p2.next = *p1
```
**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode h) {
        if (h == null || h.next == null)
            return h;
        ListNode p1 = new ListNode(h.val);
        ListNode p2 = h.next;
        ListNode p3 = p2.next;

        while (p3 != null) {
            p2.next = p1;
            p1 = p2;
            p2 = p3;
            p3 = p3.next;
        }
        p2.next = p1;
        return p2;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Reverse Linked List.  
> Memory Usage: **37.8 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Reverse Linked List.

With the help of first try, I had my origin thought achieved.

**Second try:**
```
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode h) { 
        if (h == null || h.next == null)
            return h;
        ListNode head = new ListNode(h.val);
        ListNode p1 = h;
        ListNode p2 = h.next;
        ListNode p3 = p2.next;

        while (p2 != null) {
            p1.next = p3;
            p2.next = head;
            head = p2;

            p2 = p3;
            p3 = p3 == null ? null : p3.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Reverse Linked List.  
> Memory Usage: **37.7 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Reverse Linked List.
