#### [746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)
---
On a staircase, the `i`-th step has some non-negative cost `cost[i]` assigned (0 indexed).

Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
```
**Note:**
1. cost will have a length in the range `[2, 1000]`.
1. Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range `[0, 999]`.

#### Thoughts
---
I thought the status equation is:
```
S1=v1
S2=Math.min(v2,S1)
S3=Math.min(S1+v3,S2)
.
.
Si=Math.min(Si-2 + vi, Si-1)

When input is: [10, 15, 20], the result is wrong.
```
but actually it's more like:
```
dp[0]=cost[0]
dp[1]=cost[1]

dp[i]=cost[i]+min(dp[i-1],dp[i-2])

return min(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])
```
here's why: [110111 DAYUPT's comment](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/discuss/110111/)
> For solution #1, why dp[1] = cost[1] but not dp[1] = min(cost[0],cost[1]). For once you pay the cost, you can either get on one or two stage, you even shouldn't pay the last cost, you can reach the top.
>> Oh, l understand it. I think that instead of state that to reach the i-th stair, **a better statement is to pay the i-th stair cost**. In this way it may be better understood. Nevertheless, thanks your post.



**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int min = 0;
        int[] res = new int[cost.length];
        res[0] = cost[0];
        res[1] = cost[1];
        
        for(int i=2; i<cost.length; i++){
            res[i]=Math.min(res[i-2], res[i-1])+cost[i];
        }
        return Math.min(res[cost.length-1], res[cost.length-2]);
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **1 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Min Cost Climbing Stairs.  
Memory Usage: **35.8 MB**, less than **99.44%** of Java online submissions for Min Cost Climbing Stairs.

**Second try:**
