#### 86. [Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)
---
Given a linked list and a value *x*, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example:**
```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

#### Thoughts
---
The question is easy to understand while not as easy as it looks like when I tried to solve it. I tried mark the firt and the last position of the node that no less than `x`, and move them behind the next node, return when `lastBig.next` is null. However, I juse can't write the damn code!  
And I gave up, using two listNode to store the smaller node and greater node separately, linked them back in the end. I loved my first thought better, though I didn't achieved it and even I was closed.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode h, int x) {
        if (h == null || h.next == null)
            return h;
        // break the listNode into two part
        ListNode ss = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode s = ss;
        ListNode bb = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode b = bb;

        while (h != null) {
            if (h.val < x) {
                s.next = h;
                h = h.next;
                s = s.next;
                // seems useless
                s.next = null;
            } else {
                b.next = h;
                h = h.next;
                b = b.next;
                b.next = null;
            }
        }
        s.next = bb.next;
        return ss.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Partition List.  
> Memory Usage: **36.9 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Partition List.

I thought that I might used a lot of memory but it's not. Tried to optimize the code with the same idea: 

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode h, int x) {
        if (h == null || h.next == null)
            return h;
        ListNode ss = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode s = ss;

        while (h != null && h.val < x) {
            s.next = h;
            h = h.next;
            s = s.next;
        }
        ListNode bb = h;
        while (h != null && h.next != null ) {
            // skip the smaller one
            if (h.next.val < x) {
                s.next = h.next;
                h.next = h.next.next;
                s = s.next;
            }else {
                h = h.next;
            }
        }
        s.next = bb;
        return ss.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**

The result was exactly the same, cause I barely changed nothing.  
After searching in the **Discuss**, most of the submissions using similar solution, finally I found someone had same idea with my previous thought [My-Java-Solution-one-pass-constant-extra-space](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/discuss/29264/).  
The code is quite a lot, same as mine. So I doubted that I was doing it in the wrong way again, and finally gave up. Maybe I should keep trying?
