#### 25. [Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)
---
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list *k* at a time and return its modified list.

*k* is a **positive integer** and is **less than or equal to** the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**
```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 4, you should return: 4->3->2->1->5
```
**Note:**

- Only constant extra memory is allowed.
- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

#### Thoughts

It took me quite a lot of time to solve this out, my idea was easy to understand but inefficient.
```
1)
start for the begin, find the # `k` node,
again, find the # `k-1` node, linked up,
...
find the # `0` node, linked up
2)
do the first part again and again with the rest
```
**First try:**
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        if (k <= 1 || head == null || head.next == null)
            return head;
        
        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode l = dummyHead;
        ListNode bac = head;
        ListNode tmp = new ListNode(head.val);

        int t = k - 1;
        while (t >= 0) {
            int cur = 0;
            //find the no. k node
            while (cur < t && head != null) {
                head = head.next;
                cur++;
            }
            //if k is bigger than the length return head
            if (cur < k && (head == null ))
                return bac;
            l.next = new ListNode(head.val);
            l = l.next;
            //record the start node which should be reversed next
            if (t == k - 1)
                tmp.next = head.next;
            t--;
            head = bac;
        }

        l.next = reverseKGroup(tmp.next, k);
        return dummyHead.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **14 ms**, faster than **2.83%** of Java online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.

That's too slow to be acceptable, basically my code travelled throught `n` times of listNode, where `n` is the length of listNode.  
So I tried to reduce the `n` with below code:

**Second try:**
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        if (k <= 1 || head == null || head.next == null)
            return head;

        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode l = dummyHead;
        ListNode bac = head;
        ListNode tmp = new ListNode(head.val);

        int t = k - 1;
        while (t >= 0) {
            int cur = 0;
            //find the no. k-1 node !
            while (cur < t - 1 && head != null) {
                head = head.next;
                cur++;
            }
            //if k is bigger than the length return head
            if (cur < k && (head == null || head.next == null))
                return bac;
            if(t!=0) {
                l.next = new ListNode(head.next.val);
                l = l.next;
            }
            l.next = new ListNode(head.val);
            l = l.next;
           // record the start node which should be reversed next
            if (t == k - 1)
                tmp.next = head.next.next;
            t=t-2;
            head = bac;
        }

        l.next = reverseKGroup(tmp.next, k);
        return dummyHead.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **10 ms**, faster than **5.93%** of Java online submissions for Reverse Nodes in k-Group.

As the result shows, I must had thinking this in the wrong way again, I can't get a better result using this method. Going to check the solution tomorrow.
