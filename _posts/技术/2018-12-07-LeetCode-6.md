#### 6. ZigZag Conversion
---
The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:

P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```
#### Thoughts

At the beginning, I even didn't understand what's question wants to do. This discussion: ["If you are confused with zigzag pattern,come and see!
](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/discuss/3435/If-you-are-confused-with-zigzag-patterncome-and-see!) help me with understanding and also get me some ideas.  

To me it's more like doing math, unfortunately I am not that good at math :( .  So it tooks me a lot of time to figure out the **moving pattern**. And of cause I ruined everything again.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public String convert(String s, int n) {
         if (n == 1)
            return s;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s.length());
        int l = s.length();

        int perLen = n + n - 2;
        int more = l % perLen;
        int lines = (l / 2) + (more > n ? more : 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < lines; j++) {
                // terrible way, no need to understand it
                if ((j % (n - 1) == 0 || (n - 1 - j % (n - 1)) == i) && (2 * j + i) < s.length()) {
                    sb.append(s.charAt(2 * j + i));
                }
            }
        }//for

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **83 ms**, faster than **10.18%** of Java online submissions for ZigZag Conversion.

Well, this is quite unaccessable, I guess it's because I use too many conditions inside `if`.

With the help of ["C solution, beats 100%"](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/discuss/202682/C-solution-beats-100), I realized that I had thinking in the wrong way again, or I am too stupid. The `s.charAt(n-i)` is always needed, all I have to do is to find the right `n`.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public String convert(String s, int n) {
         if (n == 1)
            return s;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s.length());
        int l = s.length();

        int step = (n - 1) * 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j + i < l) {
                sb.append(s.charAt(j + i));
                j += step;
                // this is the most important part !
                // from line1 to line(n-1), s.charAt(j-i) it's always needed
                if (i > 0 && i < n - 1 && j - i < l) {
                    sb.append(s.charAt(j - i));
                }
            }
        }//for

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **27 ms**, faster than **80.98%** of Java online submissions for ZigZag Conversion.
