#### [226. Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
---
Invert a binary tree.

**Example:**
```
Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
Output:

     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```
**Trivia:**
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

> Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

#### Thoughts

Will try to use a stack next time.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null || (root.left==null && root.right==null))
            return root;
        TreeNode ri = root.right;
        root.left = invertTree(root.left);
        root.right = invertTree(root.right);
        root.right = root.left;
        root.left = ri;
        return root;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Invert Binary Tree.  
Memory Usage: **35.6 MB**, less than **75.65%** of Java online submissions for Invert Binary Tree.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
