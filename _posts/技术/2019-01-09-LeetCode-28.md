#### 28. [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/)
---
Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```
**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

#### Thoughts

Since I had read the code of Java's `indexOf`, I came up with the code without too much problems, and of cause couldn't do any better.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
     public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if (needle.length() == 0)
            return 0;
        int res = -1;
        int i = 0;
        int matchLen = 0;
        while (i < haystack.length() && matchLen < needle.length()) {
            if (haystack.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(matchLen)) {
                i++;
                matchLen++;
            } else {
                // roll back to the next
                i = i - matchLen + 1;
                matchLen = 0;
            }
        }
        return  matchLen == needle.length() ? i - matchLen : -1;
    }
}
```
**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **12 ms**, faster than **22.70%** of Java online submissions for Implement strStr().

Nothing special, then I tried to used some ideas of KMP, tried to jump more than one step once I found char unmatched. So I record the first char's position `nex` which equal to `needle[0]`, once unequal char occurs, it may jump to `nex` directly. 

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
     public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if (needle.length() == 0)
            return 0;
        // how many steps can I jump forward if unmatched
        // which is the position of same char of needle[0]
        int nex = 0;
        for (int i = nex; i < needle.length();i++)
            if( needle.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(0)) {
                nex = i;
                break;
            }

        int i = 0;
        int matchLen = 0;
        while (i < haystack.length() && matchLen < needle.length()) {
            if (haystack.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(matchLen)) {
                i++;
                matchLen++;
            } else {
                // roll back to the next, jump to the next position
                i = i - matchLen + 1 + nex;
                matchLen = 0;
            }
        }
        return  matchLen == needle.length() ? i - matchLen : -1;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **13 ms**, faster than **20.35%** of Java online submissions for Implement strStr().

However, it's really not that affective.
