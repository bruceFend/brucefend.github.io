#### [725. Split Linked List in Parts](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/)
---
Given a (singly) linked list with head node `root`, write a function to split the linked list into `k` consecutive linked list "parts".

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring **earlier** should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.

Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are formed.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
Explanation:
The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a ListNode is [].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
Explanation:
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
```
**Note:**

- The length of `root` will be in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range `[0, 999]`.
- `k` will be an integer in the range `[1, 50]`.

#### Thoughts

Break the list into `k` parts, and only the earlier parts can be longer with no more than one node.
 So we need to know the `len` of each parts, and how many parts will be one node longer, in order to achieve this, knowing the length of input list is necessary.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode[] splitListToParts(ListNode root, int k) {
        // step one: record the length
        int len = 0;
        ListNode dummy = root;
        while(dummy!=null){
            len++;
            dummy = dummy.next;
        }
        // step two: decide how long each part, 
        // and how many parts should be longer
        int each = len / k, more = len % k;
        if(len<=k){
            each = 1;
            more = 0;
        }
        ListNode[] res = new ListNode[k];
        int c = 0;
        
        while (c < k) {
            ListNode head = root;
            int i = 0;
            // step three: add (each-1) node
            while (i < each - 1 && root != null) {
                i++;
                root = root.next;
            }
            ListNode newHead = root;
            
            if(root!=null){
                // step four: add one more node
                if (more > 0) {
                    root = root.next;
                    newHead = root.next;
                    root.next = null;
                    more--;
                }else{
                    newHead = root.next;
                    root.next = null;
                }
            }
            res[c] = head;
            root = newHead;
            c++;
        }
    
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **1 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Split Linked List in Parts.  
> Memory Usage: **37.2 MB**, less than **79.46%** of Java online submissions for Split Linked List in Parts.

It's easy to know what's the solution, yet still tooks me some time dealing with the `head` and `newHead`.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
