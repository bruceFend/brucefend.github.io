#### [328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)
---
Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and **not the value** in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
```
**Note:**

- The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

#### Thoughts
---
Using two pointer `odd` and `even`, one pointed at `h` and the other pointed at `h.next`, while `h!=null`, `odd.next = odd.next.next` and `even.next = even.next.next`, use another two pointer to record the beginning of the list. 
(Actually my way was more like storing the listNode into two listNode)

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode h) {
        if (h == null || h.next == null || h.next.next == null)
            return h;
        ListNode dummyO = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode odd = dummyO;
        ListNode dummyE = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode even = dummyE;

        while (h != null) {
            odd.next = h;
            even.next = h.next;
            odd = odd.next;
            even = even.next;
            h = h.next == null ? null : h.next.next;
        }
        odd.next = dummyE.next;
        return dummyO.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **2 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Odd Even Linked List.  
> Memory Usage: **37.8 MB**, less than **23.95%** of Java online submissions for Odd Even Linked List.
