#### [817. Linked List Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-components)
---
We are given `head`, the head node of a linked list containing **unique** integer values.

We are also given the list `G`, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in `G`, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
```
**Note:**

- If `N` is the length of the linked list given by `head`, `1 <= N <= 10000`.
- The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range `[0, N - 1]`.
- `1 <= G.length <= 10000`.
- `G` is a subset of all values in the linked list.

#### Thoughts
---
It's confusing, I thought the value in listNode was sorted, so I did not care about the head's value at all at the beginning. (Quite a lot of people say the description is horrible)

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numComponents(ListNode head, int[] G) {
        Arrays.sort(G);
        int k = 1, min = G[0], res = 1;
        while(k < G.length){
            if(G[k]-min != 1){
                res++;
            }
            min = G[k];
            k++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
```
Input: 
[0,3,2,4,1]
[3,0,2]
Output: 2
Expected: 1
```
And after some more tries, I had my second solution.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numComponents(ListNode head, int[] G) {
        Set g = new HashSet<Integer>();
        int k = 0, res = 0;
        while(k < G.length){
            g.add(G[k]);
            k++;
        }
        // if we run out of G, stop
        while(head != null && k > 0){
            // skip all the uncontained node
            while(head != null && !g.contains(head.val)){
                head = head.next;
            }
            // count for every contained node
            while(head != null && g.contains(head.val)){
                head = head.next;
                k--;
            }
            res++;
            head = head == null ? head : head.next;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **8 ms**, faster than **94.01%** of Java online submissions for Linked List Components.  
> Memory Usage: **41.6 MB**, less than **23.85%** of Java online submissions for Linked List Components.
