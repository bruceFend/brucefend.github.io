#### 31. [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)
---
Implement **next permutation**, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and **use only constant extra memory**.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.  
`1,2,3` → `1,3,2`  
`3,2,1` → `1,2,3`  
`1,1,5` → `1,5,1`


#### Thoughts
---
At the beginning, I don't really understand what is **next greater permutation**, so I test some more examples. It's an arrangement of number in lexicographically order, below is the demonstration: 
```
1,2,3,4
1,2,4,3
1,3,2,4
1,3,4,2
1,4,2,3
1,4,3,2
2,1,3,4
...
4,3,2,1
```
I was still running like a headless chicken and didn't know where to start. Finally I found out when the `nums[last] > nums[last-1]`, I can simply exchange the last two of the nums, otherwise do `last--` while the previous one is bigger than the current one. Next step is to find the number that should be placed in the `pre` position, and then reorder the remaining numbers.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
         if (nums.length >= 2) {
            int len = nums.length;
            if (nums[len - 1] > nums[len - 2]) {
                // exchange
                nums[len - 1] += nums[len - 2];
                nums[len - 2] = nums[len - 1] - nums[len - 2];
                nums[len - 1] = nums[len - 1] - nums[len - 2];
            } else {
                int cur = len - 2;
                // find the number that should be moved backword
                while (cur >= 1 && nums[cur - 1] >= nums[cur]) {
                    cur--;
                }
                if (cur != 0) {
                    int j = len - 1;
                    // find the number that should be moved ahead
                    while (j >= cur - 1 && nums[cur - 1] >= nums[j]) {
                        j--;
                    }
                    // exchange
                    nums[cur - 1] += nums[j];
                    nums[j] = nums[cur - 1] - nums[j];
                    nums[cur - 1] = nums[cur - 1] - nums[j];
                }
                // sort the remained
                sortInt(nums, cur);
            }
        }
        // System.out.println(nums.toString());
    }
    public static void sortInt(int[] ints, int startIndex){
        for (int i = startIndex; i < ints.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < ints.length; j++) {
                if (ints[i] > ints[j]) {
                    ints[i] += ints[j];
                    ints[j] = ints[i] - ints[j];
                    ints[i] = ints[i] - ints[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **15 ms**, faster than **75.51%** of Java online submissions for Next Permutation.

Still got errors with some special cases, needs to be more careful.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
