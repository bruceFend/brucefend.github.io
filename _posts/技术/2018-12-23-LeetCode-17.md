#### 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
---
Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

**Example:**
```
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
```
**Note:**

Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

#### Thoughts
---
I first thought this is quite simple until I tried to think deeper. Take `2222` as example,
```
aaaa
baaa
caaa

abbb
bbbb
cbbb

accc
bccc
cccc

.
.
.
```
easy to see that I have to go throught the length of `digits` and also every lengths of each `number`. However I found it's difficult to write the code in this way. The length of each `number` can be `3` or `4`, and number one always return `*`.  
So I had to think it in another way, take `23` as example: 
```
  - d
a - e
  - f
  
  - d
b - e
  - f

  - d
c - e
  - f
```
It's a tree! As the `digit` grows, all I have to do is appending new char to every branch of the tree.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public List<String> letterCombinations(String digits) {
       List<String> dic = Arrays.asList("", "*", "abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz");
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < digits.length(); i++) {
            int n = Integer.parseInt(digits.charAt(i) + "");
            String curDict = dic.get(n);

            if(i==0) {
                for (int j = 0; j < curDict.length(); j++) {
                    sb.append(curDict.charAt(j));
                    res.add(sb.toString());
                    sb=new StringBuilder();
                }
            }
            if (i != digits.length() - 1)
                res = addTog(res, dic.get(Integer.parseInt(digits.charAt(i + 1) + "")));
        }// for
        return res;
    }

    private static List<String> addTog(List<String> cur, String dic) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String aCur : cur) {
            for (int j = 0; j < dic.length(); j++) {
                String sb = aCur + dic.charAt(j);
                res.add(sb);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **2 ms**, faster than **81.12%** of Java online submissions for Letter Combinations of a Phone Number.

I am satisfied with the result, even though the code can be optimized.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
