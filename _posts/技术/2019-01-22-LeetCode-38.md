#### 38. Count and Say
---
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
```
Given an integer *n* where **1 ≤ n ≤ 30**, generate the n^th term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

#### Thoughts

I don't understand the question utill I watched this [explainnation](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/discuss/15995/Examples-of-nth-sequence):
> the (i+1)th sequence is the "count and say" of the i^th sequence! 

So if I want to the result of n, I have to get the `n-1` result first.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        String res = "11";
        // n <= 30 && n >= 1
        if (n <= 1 || n > 30) {
            return "1";
        }
        int i = 2;
        while (i < n) {
            res = speakNo(res);
            i++;
        }
        return res;
    }

    private static String speakNo(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ) {
            int count = 0, j = i;
            while (j < s.length() && s.charAt(j) == s.charAt(i)) {
                j++;
                count++;
            }
            sb.append(count);
            sb.append(s.charAt(j-1));
            i = j;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **2 ms**, faster than **96.85%** of Java online submissions for Count and Say.

Looks good to me.

**Second try:**

**Result 2:**
