#### [237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list)
---
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Note:**

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.

#### Thoughts
---
The input `node` is the node that you should remove, and you can't visit the listnode from the head!

**First try:**
```Java

class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Delete Node in a Linked List.  
>  Memory Usage: **36.8 MB**, less than **97.38%** of Java online submissions for Delete Node in a Linked List.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
