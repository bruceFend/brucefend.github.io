#### 30. [Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)
---
You are given a string, `s`, and a list of words, `words`, that are all of the **same length**. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a **concatenation** of each word in `words` **exactly once** and without any intervening characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```
#### Thoughts
---
I was quite disappointed when I found myself misunderstood about the question, cause I thought this shouldn't be that "hard" at the beginning. After some try, my idea was to remove every `word` once being found in the `substring` of `s`, return the current position `i` if every `word` was found. And the length of `substring` equals to `words.length * eachWordLen`.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    // #30
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        // words is empty,return empty list;
        if (words.length == 0 || (s.length() == 0 && words[0].length() > 0))
            return res;

        // words = [""], return every single number
        int eachLen = words[0].length();
        if (eachLen == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= s.length(); i++)
                res.add(i);
            return res;
        }

        HashSet<Integer> t = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i + eachLen * words.length  <= s.length(); i++) {
            StringBuilder tmp = new StringBuilder(s.substring(i , i+ eachLen * words.length));
            for (int j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
                int ind = tmp.toString().indexOf(words[j]);
                if (ind > -1) {
                    // remove found words
                    // todo: may remove the wrong substring when tmp contains words more than once !
                    tmp = tmp.replace(ind, ind + eachLen, "");
                } else {
                    break;
                }
                if (j == words.length - 1)
                    t.add(ind + i);
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(t);
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
```
Input
"ababaab"
["ab","ba","ba"]
Output []
Expected [1]
```
This is because when `i = 1` and `words = ab`, `tmp = babaab`, my code remove the first *ab* when I was trying to remove the second *ab* from `babaab`.  
After trying million times, I got the code below. I split input `s` to several part which they got same lenght with `word`, then match them with every `word` in `words`. Remove the matched word from the tmp substring, or break if tmp substring doesn't contains the `word`.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    //#30
    // words is empty,return new;
    // words = [""], return every single number
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (words.length == 0 || (s.length() == 0 && words[0].length() > 0))
            return res;

        int eachLen = words[0].length();
        if (eachLen == 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= s.length(); i++)
                res.add(i);
            return res;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i + eachLen * words.length <= s.length(); i++) {
            StringBuilder tmp = new StringBuilder(s.substring(i, i + eachLen * words.length));
            int found = 0;
            int le = words.length;
            for (int j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
                String tt;
                int ind = -1;
                // check by every word's length
                while (ind == -1 && le  >= 1) {
                    tt = tmp.substring(le * eachLen - eachLen, le * eachLen);
                    le--;
                    ind = tt.indexOf(words[j]);
                }
                if (ind > -1) {
                    found++;
                    // remove the founded word
                    tmp = tmp.replace(le * eachLen, le * eachLen + eachLen, "");
                    le = words.length - found;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (found == words.length)
                res.add(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **159 ms**, faster than **55.13%** of Java online submissions for Substring with Concatenation of All Words.

Fine with the result but not with the process.

**Update**

Found a brillian solution: [An-O(N)-solution-with-detailed-explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/discuss/13656/) ! Using this idea, the result is incredible fast!
> Runtime: **22 ms**, faster than **92.80%** of Java online submissions for Substring with Concatenation of All Words.
