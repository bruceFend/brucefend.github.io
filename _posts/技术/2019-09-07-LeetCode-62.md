#### [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
---
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

#### Thoughts

After finishing [#LeetCode 64. Minimum Path Sum](http://www.wushifengzi.xyz/2019/09/07/LeetCode-64.html), I found this one quite the same. Start from `matrix[0][0]` to `matrix[m-1][n-1]`, we can see that `matrix[m][n] = matrix[m-1][n] + matrix[m][n-1]`, so I started from the left top, and calculate every `matrix[i][j]`, return `matrix[m-1][n-1]` in the end.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m<=1 || n<=1) return 1;
        int[][] pat = new int[m][n];
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) pat[0][i]=1;
        for(int j=0;j<m;j++) pat[j][0]=1;
        
        for(int i=1;i<m;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<n;j++){
                pat[i][j]=pat[i-1][j]+pat[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return pat[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Unique Paths.  
Memory Usage: **33 MB**, less than **5.10%** of Java online submissions for Unique Paths.

**Second try:**
It works while using too many memory which means there must be some other way I can save my memory usage. Draw the matrix like below:
```
                1
            1       1
        1       2       1
    1       3       3       1
 1      4       6       4       1
```
and we should know this is "杨辉三角" or "pascals-triangle". Inspired by [C语言求杨辉三角的6种方法](https://wenku.baidu.com/view/6eec459f27d3240c8547ef91.html) I used `int[]` instead of `int[][]`, however, it turns out to be no different.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if(m<=1 || n<=1) return 1;
        int mx = Math.max(m,n);
        int mn = Math.min(m,n);
        int[] f = new int[mx];
        
        for(int i=0;i<mx;i++) f[i]=1;
        while(mn-->1){
            for(int j=1;j<mx;j++) f[j]=f[j]+f[j-1];
        }
        return f[mx-1];
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Unique Paths.
Memory Usage: **32.9 MB, less than 5.10% of Java online submissions for Unique Paths.
