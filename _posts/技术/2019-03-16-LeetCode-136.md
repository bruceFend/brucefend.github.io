#### [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
---
Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

#### Thoughts
---
Using `^` and this is tricky!
```Python
print(2 ^ 2) # 0
print(0 ^ 3) # 3
```

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            res = res ^ num;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Single Number.  
> Memory Usage: **39.4 MB**, less than **56.15%** of Java online submissions for Single Number.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
