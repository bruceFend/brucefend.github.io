#### [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree]()
---
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its minimum depth = 2.

#### Thoughts
---
Similar with [#104 Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](http://www.wushifengzi.xyz/2019/03/20/LeetCode-104.html), as one is querying for the max depth and this one is querying for the minimum depth.

Caution: depth of `[1,2]` is 2 instead of 1.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null)
            return 0;
        else if(root.left==null && root.right!=null)
            return 1+minDepth(root.right);
        else if(root.left!=null && root.right==null)
            return 1+minDepth(root.left);
        else 
            return Math.min(minDepth(root.left),minDepth(root.right))+1;
    }
   
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Minimum Depth of Binary Tree.  
Memory Usage: **40.4 MB**, less than **5.07%** of Java online submissions for Minimum Depth of Binary Tree.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
