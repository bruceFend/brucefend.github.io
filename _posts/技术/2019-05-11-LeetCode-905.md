#### [905. Sort Array By Parity](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/)
---
Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `A`, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```
**Note:**
1. `1 <= A.length <= 5000`
1. `0 <= A[i] <= 5000`

#### Thoughts

An easy one, in 《剑指Offer》 #21 has a common way for this.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] A) {
        int len = A.length;
        if(len <= 1)
            return A;
        int i = 0, j = len - 1;
        while(i<j){
            // find first odd
            while(i<j && A[i] % 2 ==0) i++;
            // find first even
            while(i<j && A[j] % 2 !=0) j--;
            
            if(i<j){
                A[i]+=A[j];
                A[j]=A[i]-A[j];
                A[i]=A[i]-A[j];
            }
        }
        
        return A;
    }
}
```
