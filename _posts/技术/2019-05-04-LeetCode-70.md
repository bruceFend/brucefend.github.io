#### [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
---
You are climbing a stair case. It takes `n` steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given `n` will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

This is Fibonacci, `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`, learn the method from 《剑指Offer》P74.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n <= 2)
            return n;
        
        int one = 1;
        int two = 2;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=3; i<=n; ++i){
            res = one + two;
            // update f(n-1) and f(n-2)
            one = two;
            two = res;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
