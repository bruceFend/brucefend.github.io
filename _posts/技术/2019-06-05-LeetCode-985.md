#### [985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-even-numbers-after-queries/)
---
We have an array `A` of integers, and an array `queries` of queries.

For the `i`-th query `val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1]`, we add val to `A[index]`.  Then, the answer to the `i`-th query is the sum of the even values of `A`.

(Here, the given `index = queries[i][1]` is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array `A`.)

Return the `answer` to all queries.  Your answer array should have `answer[i]` as the answer to the `i`-th query.

 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
Explanation: 
At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
``` 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
1. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
1. `1 <= queries.length <= 10000`
1. `-10000 <= queries[i][0] <= 10000`
1. `0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length`

#### Thoughts

Add every query in `queries` to `A`, and then check every number in `A` is the easiest way to come up with, and of couse it'll be quite slow.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] sumEvenAfterQueries(int[] A, int[][] queries) {
        int[] res = new int[queries.length];
        for(int i=0; i<queries.length; i++){
            A[queries[i][1]] += queries[i][0];
            int tmp = 0;
            for(int k: A){
                if(k%2==0)
                    tmp+=k;
            }
            res[i] = tmp;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **1226 ms**, faster than **6.71%** of Java online submissions for Sum of Even Numbers After Queries.   
Memory Usage: **53.8 MB**, less than **99.86%** of Java online submissions for Sum of Even Numbers After Queries.

That `O(n*m)`, there must be some way faster.

Calculate the even number sum first, and then update it according to the odd-even of origin number in `A` and `query`.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] sumEvenAfterQueries(int[] A, int[][] queries) {
        int[] res = new int[queries.length];
        int t = 0;  // the init even sum
        for(int k : A){
            if(k % 2==0)
                t+=k;
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<queries.length; i++){
            // if origin is even
            if(A[queries[i][1]] % 2 == 0){
                // query is even, add them up
                if(queries[i][0] % 2==0)
                    res[i] = t+queries[i][0];
                // query is odd, reduce origin
                else
                    res[i] = t-A[queries[i][1]];
            }else{
                // origin is odd, query is even
                if(queries[i][0] % 2==0)
                    res[i] = t;
                else
                    res[i] = t+queries[i][0]+A[queries[i][1]];
            }
            A[queries[i][1]] += queries[i][0];
            // update current sum
            t=res[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **4 ms**, faster than **97.88%** of Java online submissions for Sum of Even Numbers After Queries.  
Memory Usage: **58.7 MB**, less than **81.17%** of Java online submissions for Sum of Even Numbers After Queries.
