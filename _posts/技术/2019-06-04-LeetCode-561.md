#### [561. Array Partition I](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/)
---
Given an array of `2n` integers, your task is to group these integers into `n` pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```
**Note:**
- `n` is a positive integer, which is in the range of `[1, 10000]`.
- All the integers in the array will be in the range of `[-10000, 10000]`.

**Hint:**
- Obviously, brute force won't help here. Think of something else, take some example like `1,2,3,4`.
- How will you make pairs to get the result? There must be some pattern.

From the hint we can know that it's better to sort the array first, since we're looking for the max `Sum(min(ai,bi))`, if we put `(1,6), (2,5), (3,4)` toghter the result will be `1+2+3=6`, so we should do it like `(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)` and then the result will be `1+3+5=9`.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        if(len==2) return Math.min(nums[0],nums[1]);
        
        int res = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for(int i=0; i<len; i+=2)
            res+=nums[i];
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **14 ms**, faster than **92.03%** of Java online submissions for Array Partition I.  
Memory Usage: **39 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Array Partition I.

**Second try:**
