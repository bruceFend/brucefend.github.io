#### [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)
---
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.  
For example, the following two linked lists:

![i1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)
begin to intersect at node c1.

**Example 1:**

![e1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
``` 

**Example 2:**

![e2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
``` 

**Example 3:**

![e3](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)
```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

**Notes:**

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

#### Thoughts

This problem requires us to find first intersection of two linked list in O(n) time and O(1) memory, return null if there's no one found.  
My first idea was to store linkedList b, and then check if a can be found in b. Otherwise I may need more time/memory if I reverse `a` and `b`, and the find their's last common node, what's more I am not allowed to modify the node itself.

**First try:**
```Java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        if(headA==null || headB==null)
            return null;
        Set<ListNode> set = new HashSet<ListNode>();
        ListNode dummy = headB;
        // store list b
        while(dummy != null){
            set.add(dummy);
            dummy = dummy.next;
        }
        // find A in list b
        dummy = headA;
        while(dummy != null){
            if(set.contains(dummy))
                return dummy;
            else
                dummy = dummy.next;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **8 ms**, faster than **18.75%** of Java online submissions for Intersection of Two Linked Lists.  
> Memory Usage: **37 MB**, less than **39.22%** of Java online submissions for Intersection of Two Linked Lists.

So how can I do it even faster? I checkout the solution after failing several times and found [nickyramone's](https://leetcode.com/nickyramone/) comment helps alot. Brilliant idea!

> 1. Connect the last node of list B to the head of list A
> 1. Find the loop in list B using the tortoise and hare algorithm (Floyd's cycle algorithm)
> 1. Remove the connection made in 1)

It's similar with #approach3 but much easier to understand, so I tried to do this one more time.

**Second try:**
```
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        if(headA==null || headB==null)
            return null;
        ListNode dummyA = headA;
        while(headA.next != null){
            headA = headA.next;
        }
        headA.next = headB;
        ListNode res = detectCycle(dummyA);
        headA.next = null;
        return res;
    }
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next!= null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            // a cycle exists
            if (slow == fast) {
                slow = head;
                // this is the most import part
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow.next;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **1 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Intersection of Two Linked Lists.
> Memory Usage: **39.5 MB**, less than **7.45%** of Java online submissions for Intersection of Two Linked Lists.
