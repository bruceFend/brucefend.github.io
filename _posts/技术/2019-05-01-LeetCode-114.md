#### [114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)
---
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```
The flattened tree should look like:
```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

Code copy from: [Share-my-simple-NON-recursive-solution-O(1)-space-complexity!](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/discuss/37010/)

Brilliant idea! See my illustration below:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6

Step one: located the first left
    1
   / \
 [2]  5
 / \   \
3   4   6
Step two: located the last right of "first left"
    1
   / \
 [2]  5
 / \   \
3  [4]  6
Step three: move root'right to the "last right"
    1
   / 
  2   
 / \   
3   4   
     \
      5
       \
        6
Step four: root'right = root'left && root'left = null
Step five: root = root'right
1
 \ 
 [2]   
 / \   
3   4   
     \
      5
       \
        6
```

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        while(root != null){
          if(root.left != null){
              // step one
              TreeNode prev = root.left;
              // step two
              while(prev.right != null){
                  prev = prev.right;
              }
              // step three
              prev.right = root.right;
              // step four
              root.right = root.left;
              root.left = null;
          }
          // step five
          root = root.right;
      }
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List.  
Memory Usage: **39.9 MB**, less than **5.09%** of Java online submissions for Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List.
