#### [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)
---
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

**Note:**

Definition of **a complete binary tree** from Wikipedia:
> In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and **all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible**. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

#### Thoughts
---
Note that
`[1,2,3,4,5,null,8]` is an illegal input. 

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    // Maybe it can be simplified?
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null)
            return 0;
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        if(root.left!=null) left = countNodes(root.left);
        if(root.right!=null) right = countNodes(root.right);
        return left + right + 1;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Count Complete Tree Nodes.  
Memory Usage: **39.3 MB**, less than **91.14%** of Java online submissions for Count Complete Tree Nodes.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
