#### 21. [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
---
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**
```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

#### Thoughts
---
I first thought it's easy, even if I compare them one by one, the time complexity is O(n+m) and I assumed it would be fast enough.

**First try:**
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode cur = dummyHead;
        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val > l2.val) {
                cur.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            } else {
                cur.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        if (l1 != null)
            cur.next = l1;
        if (l2 != null)
            cur.next = l2;

        return dummyHead.next;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **15 ms**, faster than **5.13%** of Java online submissions for Merge Two Sorted Lists.

I was in great shocked when I saw the result, wondering what's wrong about this. 
I checked one of the most voted solution ["Java, 1 ms, 4 lines codes, using recursion"](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/discuss/9715)
but it's not as fast as it claimed.

**Second try:**
```Java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if(l1 == null) return l2;
		if(l2 == null) return l1;
		if(l1.val < l2.val){
			l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
			return l1;
		} else{
			l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
			return l2;
		}
    }
}
```
**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **12 ms**, faster than **19.01%** of Java online submissions for Merge Two Sorted Lists.

Need to spend some time on this during the weekend.
