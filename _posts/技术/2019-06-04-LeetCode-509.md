#### [509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
---
The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,
```
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
Given N, calculate F(N).
```

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Note:**
- 0 ≤ N ≤ 30.

Fibonacci Number, using iterator.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int fib(int N) {
        if(N<=1) return N;
        
        int a=0, b=1;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=2; i<=N; i++){
            res=a+b;
            a=b;
            b=res;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Fibonacci Number.  
Memory Usage: **32 MB**, less than **50.72%** of Java online submissions for Fibonacci Number.

Had no idea why it required that many memory.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
