#### 26. [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
---
Given a **sorted** array *nums*, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

**Do not** allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

It'll be much easier if we can use array or some more space, my first idea was to remove every repeted number to the **last**, which tooks me lots of time. The code down here is shit, and no need to waste your time watching it.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            int k = i;
            for (int j = i; j < nums.length - 1; i++) {
                while (j < nums.length - 1 && nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    j++;
                }
                //move the nums[i] to the last position
                while (j < nums.length) {
                    int tmp = nums[j];
                    nums[j] = nums[i + 1];
                    nums[i + 1] = tmp;
                    j++;
                    i++;
                }

            }
            i = k;
        }
        // didn't figure out how the identified the length...
        for(int i =0;i<nums.length-1;i++){
            if(nums[i]>=nums[i+1])
                return i+1;
        }

        return nums.length; 
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **445 ms**, faster than **0.99%** of Java online submissions for Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.

This is unacceptable, with some help from '峰', I decided to move every different number front, it'd be much faster.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
       if (nums.length < 2)
            return nums.length;
        int len = 1, nex = 1;
        int min = nums[0];
        int max = nums[nums.length - 1];

        //find the position for same number
        for (int i = len; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > min) {
                min = nums[i];
                len++;
                nex++;
            } else {
                //find the next bigger one to exchange
                while (nex < nums.length && nums[nex] <= min) {
                    nex++;
                }
                if (min == max)
                    return len;
                
                min = nums[nex];
                int tmp = nums[len];
                nums[len] = min;
                nums[nex] = tmp;
                len++;
            }
        }

        return len;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **12 ms**, faster than **22.65%** of Java online submissions for Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.

It's much faster than the first time, but from the unclear code itself, I knew it'd be slower than most of the others.

**Third try:**
```Java
// code from co-worker
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int p = 1, l = 1;
        for (int i = p; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // i is to find the first different no,
            // and p is used to mark the position of first same no with the pre one
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[p++] = nums[i];
                l++;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```

**Result:**
> Runtime: **11 ms**, faster than **35.07%** of Java online submissions for Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.

I have to say that it's brilliant.
