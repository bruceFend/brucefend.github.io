#### [53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
---
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

#### Thoughts
---
Had no idea about how to solve this using DP, used the method from 《剑指Offer》. And according to the book, the DP's looks just like this.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int res = nums[0], res2 = nums[0];
        if(len==1)
            return res;
        for(int i=1;i<len;i++){
            if(res <= 0)
                res = nums[i];
            else
                res += nums[i];
            if(res > res2)
                res2 = res;
        }
        return res2;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Maximum Subarray.  
Memory Usage: **38.5 MB**, less than **91.51%** of Java online submissions for Maximum Subarray.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
