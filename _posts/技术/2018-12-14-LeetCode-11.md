#### 11. Container With Most Water
---
Given *n* non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

> The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.



```
Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
#### Thoughts

It seems like I have to calculate `n!` times in order to get the max area. The smaller `height[i]` as height, and `i-j` as width.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int len = height.length;
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < len; j++) {
                int hei = height[i] > height[j] ? height[j] : height[i];
                max = hei * (j - i) > max ? hei * (j - i) : max;
            }
        }//for
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **426 ms**, faster than **8.29%** of Java online submissions for Container With Most Water.

It's quite slow, need to see others' solutions tomorrow.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
