#### 11. Container With Most Water
---
Given *n* non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

> The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.



```
Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```
#### Thoughts
---
It seems like I have to calculate `n!` times in order to get the max area. The smaller `height[i]` as height, and `i-j` as width.  

I had a new idea but found it also no good enought: 
0. record the indexs of all heights in `int[] index`, from the topest to the lowest, then we got `int[] index = [1,6,8,2,4,5,7,3,0]` in example one
1. start from the second hightest (`index[1]`), "draw" a line between `height[index[1]] = 8` to `height[index[0]`, the container's width is `index[1] - index[0]` and calculate the area as first max
2. move the `i` in the `index[i]`, `height[index[i]]` is the height of the container, for now the width should be `while(j>0 && j< i) min(index[i]-index[j])`

When we move the `i` in the `index[]`, only if the `width` is growing can we get a larger area. so the third step can be optimized by find a bigger width than the earlier one. However, the time complexity won't be faster than `O(n*log(n))` in order to the `index[]`

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int len = height.length;
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < len; j++) {
                int hei = height[i] > height[j] ? height[j] : height[i];
                max = hei * (j - i) > max ? hei * (j - i) : max;
            }
        }//for
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **426 ms**, faster than **8.29%** of Java online submissions for Container With Most Water.

Found a O(n) [solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/discuss/6100/Simple-and-clear-proofexplanation), very impressive.

> Idea / Proof:  
> 1. The widest container (using first and last line) is a good candidate, because of its width. Its water level is the height of the smaller one of first and last line.
> 2. All other containers are less wide and thus would need a higher water level in order to hold more water.
> 3. The smaller one of first and last line doesn't support a higher water level and can thus be safely removed from further consideration.

**Second try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int max = 0;
        int i=0,j=height.length-1;

        while (i < j ) {
            int hei = Math.min(height[i], height[j]);
            max = Math.max(max,hei * (j - i));
            if (height[i] < height[j])
                i++;
           else
                j--;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **5 ms**, faster than **89.40%** of Java online submissions for Container With Most Water.
