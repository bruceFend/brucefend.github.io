#### [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
---
Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (**0-indexed**) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

#### Thoughts
---
Though this is so call an 'easy' question, I still spend more than one hour to do this.   
My first thought was using two pointer, one start from the head, another start from head.next, do `sec = sec.next` while `sec.next != first`, however I couldn't find the timing for `first = first.next`, this results in Runtime error.  
At the end, someone reminded me that I can reuse the solution of [876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/), that's how I got this done.

**First try:**
```Java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode h) {
        if(h == null || h.next == null)
            return false;
        ListNode fi = h;
        ListNode sec = fi;
        while (sec != null) {
            fi = fi.next;
            sec = sec.next == null ? null : sec.next.next;
            if(sec != null && sec.next == fi)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **1 ms**, faster than **32.43%** of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle.  
> Memory Usage: **38.4 MB**, less than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle.

The time complexity is quite confusing when there's a loop, the calculation can be see [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/solution/).

**Second try:**

**Result 2:**
