#### [877. Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/)
---
Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return `True` if and only if Alex wins the game.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Alex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.
```

Note:

1. `2 <= piles.length <= 500`
1. `piles.length is even.`
1. `1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
1. `sum(piles) is odd.`

#### Thoughts
---
At first, I tried to take the bigger pile in each round which actually isn't the correct way. The question is more like **is there a chance that Alex can win the game**.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        int len = piles.length, sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<len; i++){
            sum+=piles[i];
        }
        
        int i=0, j=len-1, count=0, take=0;
        // 【Error】: I didn't take Lee into account, which means in
        // [6,30,4,5] I suspect Alex can tak [6,30]
        while(count != len >> 1){
            if(piles[i]>piles[j]){
                take+=piles[i];
                i++;
            }else{
                take+=piles[j];
                j--;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return take >= sum >> 1;
    }
}
```
**Result 1:**
```
Input: [3,7,2,3]
Output: false
Expected: true
```

**Second try:**

Copy code from [coder_hezi's comment](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/stone-game/comments/) using DP.
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGame(int[] piles) {
        int len = piles.length;
        int[][] dps = new int[len][len];
        //dps[i][i]存储当前i的石子数
        for(int i=0;i<len;i++)
            dps[i][i]=piles[i];
        
        //d=1,其实代表，先算两个子的时候
        for(int d=1;d<len;d++)
        {
            //有多少组要比较
            for(int j=0;j<len-d;j++)
            {
                //比较j到d+j
                dps[j][d+j]=Math.max(piles[j]-dps[j+1][d+j],piles[d+j]-dps[j][d+j-1]);
            }
        }
        return dps[0][len-1]>0;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **6 ms**, faster than **48.08%** of Java online submissions for Stone Game.  
Memory Usage: **35.6 MB**, less than **96.52%** of Java online submissions for Stone Game.
