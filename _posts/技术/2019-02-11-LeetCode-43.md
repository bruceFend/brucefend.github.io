#### 43. [Multiply Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)
---
Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```
**Note:**

1. The length of both `num1` and `num2` is < 110.
2. Both `num1` and `num2` contain only digits `0-9`.
3. Both `num1` and `num2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
4. You must **not use any built-in BigInteger library** or **convert the inputs to integer directly**.


#### Thoughts
---
Since we're not allowed to convert the inputs to integer directly while the lenghts of inputs are also too long for an integer, we need to think of other way to solve this.  This's simillar with adding two bigInteger, we can product every digit and sum the up. But this will be `O(n*m)`, so I check others' solutions to see whether's a better idea to do this. 

With the help of the picture from [Easiest-JAVA-Solution-with-Graph-Explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/discuss/17605) (which actually same idea with mine)

I found it's quite interesting how they do multiplication, in China we'll probably write it in this way and can't find the relation between `i`, `j` and `i+j+1`:

Code below is from [AC-solution-in-Java-with-explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/discuss/17608)

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public String multiply(String num1, String num2) {
      if (!num1.equals("0") && !num2.equals("0")) {

            int n1 = num1.length(), n2 = num2.length();
            int[] products = new int[n1 + n2];
            for (int i = n1 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                for (int j = n2 - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                    int d1 = num1.charAt(i) - '0';
                    int d2 = num2.charAt(j) - '0';
                    products[i + j + 1] += d1 * d2;
                }
            }
            int carry = 0;
            for (int i = products.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                int tmp = (products[i] + carry) % 10;
                carry = (products[i] + carry) / 10;
                products[i] = tmp;
            }
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (int num : products) sb.append(num);
            while (sb.length() != 0 && sb.charAt(0) == '0') sb.deleteCharAt(0);
            return sb.length() == 0 ? "0" : sb.toString();

        }
        return "0";  
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **13 ms**, faster than **91.51%** of Java online submissions for Multiply Strings. \
> Memory Usage: **27.9 MB**, less than **24.75%** of Java online submissions for Multiply Strings.

My code will definitely be much more longer than this if I do it by myself though the basic idea is the same.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
