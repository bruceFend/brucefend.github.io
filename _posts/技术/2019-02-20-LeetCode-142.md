#### [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
---
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: **Do not** modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it **without** using extra space?

#### Thoughts
---
This one is similar to the [#141](http://www.wushifengzi.xyz/2019/02/20/LeetCode-141.html) and I thought I can just reuse the code by changing return statement. I can return the `secNode` instead of true of false.  

And of cause it requires extra space, but how can we have this done without using extra space and not modify the list at the same the time?


**First try:**
```Java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null)
            return null;
        ListNode first = head;
        ListNode sec = first.next; // this's a mistake
        while(sec!=null){
            if(sec.next == null || sec.next.next == null)
                return null;
            first = first.next;
            sec = sec.next.next;
            if(sec.next == first){
                return first;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
**Result 1:**
```
Input: 
[3,2,0,-4]
0
Output: tail connects to node index 3
Expected: tail connects to node index 0
```
Why would this happened? Anything wrong? Let's see what'd happened.
```
[3 2 0 4] 0
1. first = 3, sec = 2, continue
2. first = 2, sec = 4, continue
3. first = 0, sec = 2, sec.next == first, return first
```
See? The code can only tell us whether there's a cycle in the linked list, but fail to tell us where the cycle begins.

Then I checkout others' discussion after one more hour, and found a very good one [Concise O(n) solution by using C++ with Detailed Alogrithm Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/discuss/44781/). It gave us an conclusion: 
> the distance **between the head location and entry location** is *equal to* the distance **between the meeting location and the entry location** along the direction of forward movement.

And only by now I realized my first try was totally wrong, cause my `secNode(fastNode)` is started from `head.next`.

**Second try:**
```Java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next!= null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            // a cycle exists
            if (slow == fast) {
                slow = head;
                // this is the most import part
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow.next;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Result 2:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle II.
> Memory Usage: **34.5 MB**, less than **78.01%** of Java online submissions for Linked List Cycle II.
