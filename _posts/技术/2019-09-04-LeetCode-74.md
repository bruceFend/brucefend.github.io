#### [74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)
---
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 13
Output: false
```

#### Thoughts

Go through the matrix from right top to left buttom.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int h = matrix.length;
        if(h<1) return false;
        int w = matrix[0].length;
        
        int i=w-1,j=0;
        while(i>=0 && j<h){
            if(matrix[j][i]==target)
                return true;
            if(matrix[j][i]<target)
                j++;
            if(i<0 || j>=h) break;
            if(matrix[j][i]>target)
                i--;
        }//while
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **1 ms**, faster than **11.83%** of Java online submissions for Search a 2D Matrix.  
Memory Usage: **41.9 MB**, less than **6.06%** of Java online submissions for Search a 2D Matrix.

Well, this is too slow to be accepted. Will try another time.

**Second try:**


**Result 2:**
