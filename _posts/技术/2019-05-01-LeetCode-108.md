#### [108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)
---
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

#### Thoughts

Though this's an easy one, I still failed to solve it, until I checkout other's solution "[My-Accepted-Java-Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/discuss/35220/)".

**First try:**
```Java
// my wrong answer
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        return helper(nums,0,len);
    }
    // here I got problem with the breaking condition, I don't
    public TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int st, int ed){
        int mid = (st+ed)/2;
        int root = nums[mid];
        TreeNode res = new TreeNode(root);
        if(st==ed)
            return res;
        // this is useless, but if I set this free, it'd result to stackOverFlow
        if(ed-st != 1){
            res.left = helper(nums,st,mid - 1);
            res.right = helper(nums,mide,ed);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

// answer from others
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        int len = nums.length;
        return helper(nums,0,len-1);
    }
    public TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int st, int ed){
        // here is what I didn't figure out.
        if(ed < st)
            return null;
        int mid = (st+ed)/2;
        int root = nums[mid];
        
        TreeNode res = new TreeNode(root);
        res.left = helper(nums,st,mid - 1);
        res.right = helper(nums,mid + 1,ed);
        return res;
    }
}
```
