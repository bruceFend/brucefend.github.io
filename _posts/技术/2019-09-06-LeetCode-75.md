#### [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
---
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a **one-pass** algorithm using only constant space?

#### Thoughts
---
Two-pass using couting sort, have no idea how to do this with only one pass.

**First try:**
```Java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int[] cou = new int[3];
        for(int i:nums){
            cou[i]++;
        }
        int i = 0;
        while(i<cou[2]){
            nums[i+cou[0]+cou[1]]= 2;
            i++;
        }
        i = 0;
        while(i<cou[1]){
            nums[i+cou[0]]= 1;
            i++;
        }
        i = 0;
        while(i<cou[0]){
            nums[i]= 0;
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```

**Result 1:**
> Runtime: **0 ms**, faster than **100.00%** of Java online submissions for Sort Colors.  
Memory Usage: **35.2 MB**, less than **99.21%** of Java online submissions for Sort Colors.

**Second try:**
